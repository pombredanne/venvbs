Virtualenv Bootstrap (a.k.a. ``venvbs``)
========================================

This module provides a quick and dirty (emphasis on dirty) method of
creating a virtualenv, without installing anything on your system,
other than Python itself.

You do not install ``venvbs``, you simply download and run it, with
the arguments you would also pass to ``virtualenv``.
